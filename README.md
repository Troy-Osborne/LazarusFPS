# LazarusFPS
First Person shooter engine in Lazarus (object pascal IDE built on FPC), porting from my pygame FPS prototype before I vectorize it all with numpy arrays.  Currently I'm using TCanvas.Rectangle and TCanvas.Pixel with a timer for the draw function but am in the process of optimising it by reimplementing it with scanlines and a mainloop. WIP!
